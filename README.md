# Cinematic  
  
A movie rental system created as a school project for CSC 445 Software Engineering.  
This project is powered by python and the Flask framework.  

The backend of Cinematic is written in Python. The Python Flask package is utilized to initialize the app and run an instance on a local web server. Pythonâ€™s SQLalchemy package is utilized to initialize an instance of a database in order to store the information of users,  payment information, and create a cart.
Movies are stored as JSON objects and displayed on the movies page.
The front end of Cinematic is written in Javascript and HTML. The front end creates the graphical interface a user can interact with as well as communicating to the backend.
